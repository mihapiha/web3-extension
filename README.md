# Kohl Tip - browser extension for tipping KohlCoin

This is a browser extension for tipping KohlCoin (now defunct) on the imageboard forum.

It was developed and tested on Chromium browser with [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) ethereum wallet installed. Firefox has problems with MetaMask on Kohlchan ([relevant bug](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/3133)).

## Installing
- download kohltip.zip from *build* directory in this repository
- in Chrome go to: `chrome://extensions`
- enable developer mode
- click _Load unpacked_ and select the project directory
- do not delete directory with extension!
- tip some users :)
